# Documents

## Description

Document portal

The document portal allows to make files from the outside world available to sandboxed applications in a controlled way.

Exported files will be made accessible to the application via a fuse filesystem that gets mounted at `/run/user/$UID/doc/`. The filesystem gets mounted both outside and inside the sandbox, but the view inside the sandbox is restricted to just those files that the application is allowed to access.

Individual files will appear at `/run/user/$UID/doc/$DOC_ID/filename`, where \$DOC_ID is the ID of the file in the document store. It is returned by the [org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.Add](#org-freedesktop-portal-documents-add) and [org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.AddNamed](#org-freedesktop-portal-documents-addnamed) calls.

The permissions that the application has for a document store entry (see [org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.GrantPermissions](#org-freedesktop-portal-documents-grantpermissions)) are reflected in the POSIX mode bits in the fuse filesystem.

The D-Bus interface for the document portal is available under the bus name org.freedesktop.portal.Documents and the object path /org/freedesktop/portal/documents.

This documentation describes version 5 of this interface.

## Methods

### org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.GetMountPoint

    GetMountPoint (
      OUT path ay
    )

Returns the path at which the document store fuse filesystem is mounted. This will typically be `/run/user/$UID/doc/`.

path  
the path at which the fuse filesystem is mounted

### org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.Add

    Add (
      IN o_path_fd h,
      IN reuse_existing b,
      IN persistent b,
      OUT doc_id s
    )

Adds a file to the document store. The file is passed in the form of an open file descriptor to prove that the caller has access to the file.

o_path_fd  
open file descriptor for the file to add

reuse_existing  
whether to reuse an existing document store entry for the file

persistent  
whether to add the file only for this session or permanently

doc_id  
the ID of the file in the document store

### org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.AddNamed

    AddNamed (
      IN o_path_parent_fd h,
      IN filename ay,
      IN reuse_existing b,
      IN persistent b,
      OUT doc_id s
    )

Creates an entry in the document store for writing a new file.

o_path_parent_fd  
open file descriptor for the parent directory

filename  
the basename for the file

reuse_existing  
whether to reuse an existing document store entry for the file

persistent  
whether to add the file only for this session or permanently

doc_id  
the ID of the file in the document store

### org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.AddFull

    AddFull (
      IN o_path_fds ah,
      IN flags u,
      IN app_id s,
      IN permissions as,
      OUT doc_ids as,
      OUT extra_out a{sv}
    )

Adds multiple files to the document store. The file is passed in the form of an open file descriptor to prove that the caller has access to the file.

If the `as-needed-by-app` flag is given, files will only be added to the document store if the application does not already have access to them. For files that are not added to the document store, the `doc_ids` array will contain an empty string.

Additionally, if `app_id` is specified, it will be given the permissions listed in [org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.GrantPermissions](#org-freedesktop-portal-documents-grantpermissions).

The method also returns some extra info that can be used to avoid multiple roundtrips. For now it only contains as “mountpoint”, the fuse mountpoint of the document portal.

This method was added in version 2 of this interface.

Support for exporting directories was added in version 4 of this interface.

o_path_fds  
open file descriptors for the files to export

flags  
flags, 1 == `reuse_existing`, 2 == `persistent`, 4 == `as-needed-by-app`, 8 = `export-directory`

app_id  
an application ID, or empty string

permissions  
the permissions to grant, possible values are ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘grant-permissions’ and ‘delete’

doc_ids  
the IDs of the files in the document store

extra_out

### org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.AddNamedFull

    AddNamedFull (
      IN o_path_fd h,
      IN filename ay,
      IN flags u,
      IN app_id s,
      IN permissions as,
      OUT doc_id s,
      OUT extra_out a{sv}
    )

Creates an entry in the document store for writing a new file.

If the `as-needed-by-app` flag is given, file will only be added to the document store if the application does not already have access to it. For file that is not added to the document store, the `doc_id` will contain an empty string.

Additionally, if `app_id` is specified, it will be given the permissions listed in [org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.GrantPermissions](#org-freedesktop-portal-documents-grantpermissions).
