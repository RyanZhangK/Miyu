# Session

## Description

Shared session interface

The Session interface is shared by all portal interfaces that involve long lived sessions. When a method that creates a session is called, if successful, the reply will include a session handle (i.e. object path) for a Session object, which will stay alive for the duration of the session.

The duration of the session is defined by the interface that creates it. For convenience, the interface contains a method [org.freedesktop.portal.Session.Close](#org-freedesktop-portal-session-close), and a signal [org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Closed](#org-freedesktop-portal-session-closed). Whether it is allowed to directly call [org.freedesktop.portal.Session.Close](#org-freedesktop-portal-session-close) depends on the interface.

The handle of a session will be of the form `/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop/session/SENDER/TOKEN`, where `SENDER` is the caller’s unique name, with the initial `:` removed and all `.` replaced by `_`, and `TOKEN` is a unique token that the caller provided with the `session_handle_token` key in the options vardict of the method creating the session.

The token that the caller provides should be unique and not guessable. To avoid clashes with calls made from unrelated libraries, it is a good idea to use a per-library prefix combined with a random number.

A client who started a session vanishing from the D-Bus is equivalent to closing all active sessions made by said client.
