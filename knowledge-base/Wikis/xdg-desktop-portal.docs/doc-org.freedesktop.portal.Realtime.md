# Realtime

## Description

Portal for setting threads to realtime

Interface for setting a thread to realtime from within the sandbox. It is analogous to the org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1 interface and will proxy requests there but with pid mapping. The latter is necessary in the case that sandbox has pid namespace isolation enabled.

Note that this proxy does not bypass any limitations that RealtimeKit imposes on processes which are documented here: [https://git.0pointer.net/rtkit.git/tree/README](https://git.0pointer.net/rtkit.git/tree/README)

This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
