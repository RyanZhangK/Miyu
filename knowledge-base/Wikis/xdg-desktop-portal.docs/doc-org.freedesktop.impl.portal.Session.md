# Session

## Description

Shared session interface

The Session interface is shared by all portal interfaces that involve long lived sessions. When a method that creates a session is called, the reply will include a session handle (i.e. object path) for a Session object, which will stay alive for the duration of the session.

The portal can abort the interaction by calling [org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session.Close](#org-freedesktop-impl-portal-session-close) on the Session object.
