# Power Profile Monitor

## Description

Power Profile monitoring portal

The Power Profile Monitor interface provides information about the user-selected system-wide power profile, to sandboxed applications. It is not a portal in the strict sense, since it does not involve user interaction. Applications are expected to use this interface indirectly, via a library API such as the GLib GPowerProfileMonitor interface.

This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
