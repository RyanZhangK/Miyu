# Permission Store

## Description

Database to store permissions

The permission store can be used by portals to store permissions that sandboxed applications have to various resources, such as files outside the sandbox.

Since the resources managed by portals can be varied, the permission store is fairly free-form: there can be multiple tables; resources are identified by an ID, as are applications, and permissions are stored as string arrays. None of these strings are interpreted by the permission store in any way.

In addition, the permission store allows to associate extra data (in the form of a GVariant) with each resource.

This document describes version 2 of the permission store interface.
